1. ECG Heartbeat Classification-A Deep Transferable Representation
Mohammad Kachuee, Shayan Fazeli, and Majid Sarrafzadeh. "ECG Heartbeat Classification: A Deep Transferable Representation." (arXiv:1805.00794)

Based on the model presented in the paper, I build a ResNet model implemented with keras to figure out 5 classes of ECG diagnoses. Dataset is available in kaggle.
